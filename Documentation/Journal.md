# My personal journey.

I will write whatever I feel after working on the library here.

Probably nothing related to the library itself. However, as I said
This is my personal learning project and I believe that emotions
and attachment is neccessary part of learning.

I will try to be consistent with this project, unlike how I treat
the previous ones.

I am particularly happy today. The library is working (even though it needs more concrete structure).
I had 5 days weekend; went back home, see my family, my grandpa getting better.

I want to work hard.
